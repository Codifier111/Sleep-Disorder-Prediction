# Abstract

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts sleep disorders based on symptoms reported by individuals. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep apnea significantly impact an individual's health and quality of life. 

# Problem Statement

Analyse the Sleep disorder dataset to explore the machine learning algorithms and build Machine Learning model to predict the disease.

# Roadmap to create ML model

# Conclusion
    
By leveraging machine learning techniques to predict sleep disorders based on reported symptoms, from this project the best acccuracy, I have got is 94.61% for Random Forest after tuning parameters using Gridsearch CV which aims to assist healthcare professionals in early identification and intervention, ultimately improving the management and treatment of sleep-related conditions.
